# Task c

Katya has a busy day at work. She needs to transfer n different contracts to her colleagues. All meetings take place on different floors, and between floors you can only move along flights of stairs - it is believed that this improves the physical fitness of employees.
The passage of each span takes exactly 1 minute.

Now Katya is on the parking floor, planning her route. Colleagues can be visited in any order, but one of them will leave the office in t minutes. There are no stairs from the parking floor - only an elevator that can take you to any floor.
As a result, Katya's plan is as follows:
Take the elevator to a random floor. It is believed that the elevator rises to any floor in 0 minutes.
Transfer contracts to all colleagues, moving between floors on the stairs. It is believed that contracts on the floor are transferred instantly.
In the first t minutes, transfer the contract to the colleague who plans to leave.
Climb the minimum number of flights of stairs.
Help Katya complete all the points of her plan.

Input data format

The first line contains positive integers n and t (2<=n,t<=100) — the number of employees and the time when one of the employees leaves the office (in minutes). The next line contains n numbers — the numbers of the floors where the employees are located. All numbers are different and do not exceed 100 in absolute value. Floor numbers are given in ascending order. The next line contains the number of the employee who will leave in t minutes.

Output format

Print a single number — the minimum possible number of flights of stairs that Katya needs to go through.

Comment
In the first example, there is enough time for Katya to go up the floors in order.
In the second example, Katya will need to go up to the leaving employee, and then go through all the others - for example, in the order {1,2,3,4,6}.
