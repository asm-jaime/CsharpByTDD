Artifact Assembly System

Assembling parts of artifacts is a complex and meticulous task. Your mission is to develop a system to track artifacts and their constituent parts.

Your system must support the following operations:

    CREATE <part_id>: Register a new artifact consisting of the part with identifier <part_id>, if this part is not already associated with an existing artifact. If the part is already part of an artifact, output ERROR: EXISTING PART.

    MERGE <artifact_id1> <artifact_id2>: Merge the artifacts with identifiers <artifact_id1> and <artifact_id2> into a new artifact. Collect all parts from both artifacts into the new one. The artifacts <artifact_id1> and <artifact_id2> become obsolete and will not be used in further operations. Output the artifact_id of the new merged artifact.

    GET_PARTS <artifact_id>: Output all part_ids that comprise the artifact with identifier <artifact_id>, separated by spaces. If the artifact does not exist, output ERROR: NO SUCH ARTEFACT.

    EXIT: Terminate the program.

Input Format:

    Each line contains one of the commands described above.
    <part_id> is a string of up to 20 lowercase English letters and digits (0â€“9).
    The total number of commands (excluding EXIT) does not exceed 105105.
    The number of GET_PARTS commands does not exceed 100.

Output Format:

    For CREATE <part_id>: Output a new unique artifact_id (a string of up to 20 lowercase letters and digits) if the part is not already associated with an artifact. Otherwise, output ERROR: EXISTING PART.

    For MERGE <artifact_id1> <artifact_id2>: Output a new unique artifact_id of the merged artifact.

    For GET_PARTS <artifact_id>: Output all part_ids of the artifact, separated by spaces. If the artifact does not exist, output ERROR: NO SUCH ARTEFACT.

Constraints:

    All artifact_ids are unique strings of up to 20 lowercase letters and digits.
    It is guaranteed that the total number of part_ids output does not exceed 2*10^5.

Sample Interaction:

Server:
CREATE p1
CREATE p2
MERGE paws tail
CREATE p3
MERGE whiskers body
GET_PARTS cat001
EXIT

Client:
paws	
tail
body
whiskers
cat001
p1 p2 p3
