# Consecutive group

Write a function int Descriptions(int[] arr) that takes an array of integers arr as input and returns the total number of descriptions for the array. The array can contain any integers, not necessarily sorted. A "description" is defined as any representation of the array where consecutive numbers can be grouped together. For each group of consecutive numbers, the number of ways to describe this group is 2^n, where n is the number of consecutive numbers in the group. The total number of descriptions for the array is the product of the descriptions for each group of consecutive numbers found within the array.
