#FizzBuzzChallenge

Write a program that displays the numbers from 1 to 100.
In this case, instead of numbers that are multiples of three, the program should display the word “Fizz”,
and instead of numbers that are multiples of five - the word "Buzz". If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5,
then the program should display the word "FizzBuzz"
